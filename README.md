# Chrome-Dinosaur-Game-

**Overview:**
This project is an implementation of the classic Chrome Dino Game using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) in C++. The game brings the nostalgic experience of the offline T-Rex jumping over obstacles to avoid collisions.

# Description 
The logic set for this game is following:
1. The cactus, T-rex, and start/stop disclaimers are all images.
2. When space key is pressed the t-rex image is just hopped over cactus.
3. When frames of image cactus and t-rex are matching the game considers it as a collision and the game is over.
4. When game is over a gameover sound is played.

# Features
User-Friendly Controls: Press the space bar or up key to make the T-Rex jump effortlessly.
Dynamic Obstacles: Navigate through randomly generated cactus obstacles, providing a challenging gaming experience.
Speed: After each 5 seconds speed increases to make game more challenging.
Scoring System: Keep track of your score based on successful obstacle avoidance.
Sounds: Game uses sounds that makes it more captivative.

# Prerequisites
Before running the game, ensure that you have the SFML library installed on your system.
